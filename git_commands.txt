git --version

-Check user name and email
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.name

-git config --global --edit  edit username and password
To exit from vim
Esc 
:w save
:q exit

-If want to make changes in name and email
git config --global user.name "new user name"
git config --global user.email "new user email"

-Create foler for git repository
mkdir newfolder
cd newfilder
git init   :git initialized
ls
ls -a : .get repository is created 

Create new file in repository Hello.java

git status                :will tell what changes made in this repository

--ADD			   File Hello.java is created but not added yet
git add Hello.java        :add file which is not adde in git
git add --all  		  :Add multiple file   Note: The shorthand command for git add --all is git add -A
git status                :files are added to the Staging Environment, and we are ready to do our first commit. 
    new file Hello.java
--COMMIT
git commit -m "initial commit meaningfull comment"
Git Commit Log:-To view the history of commits for a repository, you can use the log command:
git log    		  :how many commit has made so far hashcode is generated for each commited

--Now make some changes in file Hello.java or project
git status
  modified Hello.java
--Now create one file Driver.java
git status
  modified:   Hello.java
  Untracked files: Driver.java

Now add changes
git add Driver.java
git status
still Hello.java is not in staging bcz not added yet in staging so at this stage if we commit any changes, than only one file will be commited that is Driver.java

Now commit new file with comment
git commit -m "Driver java class created"
  Now two commit hashcode is visible commit 98a959b70c72320edfdc196ac9df9dbfc1c0b13b (HEAD -> master) here HEAD move commit to commit basis

[git help --all See All Possible Commands
cmd + k /clear  cls
fishshell extention for auto code]

git add .     :all file staging me aajayegi
git log       :will show all commit so far we have make 3 changes

>Now we can go to at any change time in bach date/time
	If we want to go at initial commit than we have below commands
	Currently showing hash code is latest commit so got to below one
 
Goback privious change:
git checkout <commit hash code/branch name> :previous date/time code can checkout. Branch name example "commit e95f195769dd391ec9d8d2dff0a51c48139f8393"
git checkout e95f195769dd391ec9d8d2dff0a51c48139f8393"
    After checkout we are in initial commit and tha current changes is not in initial commit
    By using checkout we can go at any state of changes made

Now if we check 
D:\git_tutorial_vscode_demo>git branch
* (HEAD detached at e95f195)
  master
git log   :it will show only this stage changes if only commit then show only one commit 

Now go back to master/current stage
git checkout master  :come back to current face 
git log   :now again all commit is visible to us 

>How to create new branch? Basicly there is master branch from this we can create multiple branches
:We can create many branches from master branch, So that every developer can work on their own branch. 
,So that changes made in on branch will not impact on others.We can also make many branche from one branch.


In production there is one 'master' branch and one is 'dev' branch

--Create branch----
git branch <branch name> 
  :git branch dev    :new branch created
git checkout dev 	:now we are in dev also not recommanded to work here so create one mere branch
git checkout -b <branch name> 		:new branch will creat and direclty can checkout

git checkout -b rajkashy/multiply 	:so we can recognise who is working on what/So whatever changes we will make here will not impect to other branch
git status
git add newfile.java
git commit -m "added newfile.java"

git checkout dev  :we are now in dev branch/
git log           :changes made in rajkashy/multiply will not display in dev.
git merge rajkashy/multiply :now this branch will merge in dev branch
git log           :all changes will now appear in dev also

Before commiting in master branch first confirm in dev that everything is working file only than make changes in master branch. 
git checkout master :now in master branch
git log             :master did't know changes made sofare
Now confirm everything is working fin than merge in dev only
git merge dev   :dev branch is merge in master 
git log         :now all changes from dev is in dev now than we send master to production 
Basicaly multiple programer can work on diffrent branch and each brache is independent from each other

--IGNORE--
Ignore file :If we do not want to send it to git eco system
secretkey.txt  :create file which we want to ignore

touch .gitignore  :now file .gitignore is created and can put secretkey.txt file here 

or can directly create file .gitignore 
git status 
	.gitignore
	secretkey.txt
now write file name(secretkey.txt) in ".gitignore" file will not dispaly in git status and git will not track that file
we can also put  .gitignore in .gitignore so this file also will not track
git status
--------------
GitHub :now come to the githug in you profile
-------------
Add local repositorory to github
-create one branch can create same name which is declare in local repository after creating github will ask what we want to do 
aslo mention command for localrepository and new recository follow commands

Create new repository with same name as git -->descripbe->public/private etc create repository
now it will ask for setup:-what we want to do-> where we want to create new one or repository is already exist.
她r create a new repository on the command line/她r push an existing repository from the command line/她r import code from another repository
echo "# git_tutorial_vscode_demo" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/rajkashy889/git_tutorial_vscode_demo.git
git push -u origin main

So in case we have already repository created so we will follow below steps

她r push an existing repository from the command line
git remote -v :initialy it will not display anything 

git remote add origin https://github.com/rajkashy889/git_tutorial_vscode_demo.git

git remote -v :now it will tell the origin for fetch or push
origin  https://github.com/rajkashy889/git_tutorial_vscode_demo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/rajkashy889/git_tutorial_vscode_demo.git (push)
now origin has been created where we can do push or pull  
git branch -M main     (master):push
git push -u origin main (master):changes push in origin(origin name could be anything but its convention)
will ask for authentication enter your credential it ask for first time
CONGRATULATIONS YOUR FIRST COMMIT HAS BE DONE

Repeated code
[Copy commands and run from vscode terminal or cmd FOR MASTER
git remote -v
git remote add origin(can give any name but its convantion) https:...
git remote -v
git branch -M  mster
git push -u origin master
-will give error if try to push with diffrent user name so first remove from key chain and login with current user and password
enter   github username:
	and password
Fist time will ask ueser and password but later it will store in key chain 
Congrats first commint is done.]

Now make any changes

git add filename.java
git commit -m "msg"
git push (here no need to write bcz by default its origin and master)

Now we have multiple branch to push do same thing 
git checkout dev
git push -u origin dev (dev branch will also push )
This time it will not ask credentials 
now got to git hug dev branch is also pushed

Do same for rajkashy/multiply
git checkout rajkashy/multiply
git push -u origin rajkashy/multiply

How multiple developer can work in a project?
There is two way 
   1.make is opensource so developer can fork and make changes and send pull requests
   2.or if we want developer can make changes in same code for this we can add collabrator
	Settin->manage access->invite a collabrator->enter name/email 

now developer can access same repo and clone on their own repository and make changes ->than changes can push

How can contribute to others code or forke ,clone, pull, push?
-Add others code to our repository
Create new repository public for opensource anyone can access this repo->can fork any one and contribute anyone
Now those who want to contribue he can fork so new repository will created on his githug->now can make any changes in it->
Now clone on our local repo
copy https: link from projet

come to git vscode repository(or else) select directory where you want to clone
git clone <repo url>
ls
....
now go to git command from vscode

git config --global --edit  :will show user and password of current user if we want to change user make changes here

vim <file name> :is a editor lear how to edit here
i :for insert 
Esc :wq! or x! Enter  exit and save from editor
Exit without saving :q!
cat <filename> :check what changes has made
Learn command for vim editor

create new branch and make changes in it not in master
git add <file name>
git commit -m "msg"
git push 

now got to github can see make changes there
changes will show on forke not to master/owner 
now got to 'contrubute' option->open pull request->create pull request(before create, check what changes has made so far)->add comment-review again-create pull request

now master/owner will chech what changes has made
owner will check->pull request->Filechange->review change->approve..->review merge pull request -merge :now changes made in original repository ->
in commint it will show who commited.
So that multiple request can come and contrubute in opensource project

"Practice it now you will become master in it."
